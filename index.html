    <p>Hi! I'm Ricky and I'm a bit obsessed with WordPress, lately. Somehow it's become the common thread that runs through all the work I do. At <a href="https://woodst.com" title="Wood Street Inc.">my day job</a>, I fulfill client requirements by developing WordPress themes. In the evenings and on the weekends, I organize meetups through <a href="https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-frederick/">WordPress Frederick</a>. I also like to browse the official WordPress support forum to help people out on there.</p>
    <p>WordPress empowers me to build cool stuff within a predictable structure. It enables my clients to work with their own content in a familiar dashboard. As a web enthusiast, I like to try new frameworks and software because it's a lot of fun to tinker, to approach problems from different angles. But I always happily come back to WordPress.</p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>Working with the various web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP) makes me feel like a wizard, honestly. When I was 12 years old I discovered that I could write choose-your-own-adventure games on my TI-86 graphing calculator with TI-BASIC. Decades later, I'm still endlessly fascinated with giving computers instructions to carry out. Coding both sates and fuels my curiosity, like a perpetual motion machine that keeps me moving forward.</p>
    <p>Shout-out to <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> for helping me turn my hobby into a career!</p>

    <h2>Favorite Tools</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the tools that I currently enjoy using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://localwp.com/">Local</a> spins up WordPress sites in seconds so I can experiment freely.</li>
      <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> with <a href="http://aka.ms/vscodevim">Vim emulation</a> gets me right into that brain-to-code flow state.</li>
      <li><a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> is an alternative keyboard layout that makes touch typing feel effortless.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> can be used to automate anything, which is a fun challenge on its own!</li>
      <li><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> and <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a> give me granular power over the sites I visit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>This Site</h2>
    <p>WordPress is my hammer and I admit it can make every website project look like a nail. But a database-driven content management system is overkill for a site like this one. To introduce myself and share some interesting links, I really only need a basic set of HTML pages. So that's what I've put together here. I dropped in a minimalist stylesheet from <a href="https://simplecss.org/">Simple.css</a> to keep the content pleasantly readable. For me, the most attractive advantage of this tiny static site is I can host it anywhere. I chose <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
    <p>As I write this, I'm manually moving markup tags out of my way to get my thoughts onto the page. Tight integration with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a major feature of GitHub Pages, which gives me a great excuse to try that soon!</p>
